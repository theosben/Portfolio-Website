=-=-=-=-=-=- About Me -=-=-=-=-=-=

Hello! I am Ben Burgess, a front-end web developer living in Manchester, UK. I've always been passionate about technology and understanding how things work, ever since I was a kid. I've also always been passionate about creativity, and studied music performance and music composition when I was younger. These are the things that make me who I am today; A blend of technical and creative approaches, always thinking dynamically to overcome challenges and create new things.

I've been working for the last seven years as a purchasing supervisor, which has been a demanding role. But the role has also given me strong core skills - to always be the best I can be at what I do, to always improve, to always be professional, calm and reliable, to be self-disciplined to work alone effectively and to have the right attitude and skills to lead a team. I put these core skills into everything I do, and it's what makes me... me!

Original website for comparison can be found here[link to TSG website]"
